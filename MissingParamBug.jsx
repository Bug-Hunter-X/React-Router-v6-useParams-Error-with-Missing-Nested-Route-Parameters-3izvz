In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component that's nested several levels deep.  If a parameter is missing from the URL, even if it's expected, `useParams()` will return an empty object, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.  For instance, if your route looks like `/users/:userId/profile/:profileId` and the URL is just `/users/123/profile`, fetching `params.profileId` will throw an error or render undefined, resulting in a crash or incorrect display.
